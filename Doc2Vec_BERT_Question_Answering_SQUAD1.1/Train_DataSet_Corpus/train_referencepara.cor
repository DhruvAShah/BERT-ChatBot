You can join two or more Unity Connection servers or clusters (up to a maximum of ten) to form a well connected network, referred to as a Unity Connection site. The servers joined to the site are referred to as locations. (When a Unity Connection cluster is configured, the cluster counts as one location in the site.) Within a site, each location uses SMTP to exchange directory synchronization information and messages directly with every other location. Each location is said to be linked to every other location in the site via an intrasite link. You can use an intersite link to connect one Unity Connection site to another Unity Connection site, allowing you to scale your organization from ten locations to a maximum of 20. You can also use an intersite link to connect a Unity Connection server or site to a Cisco Unity server or Cisco Unity digital network. The linked sites are referred to as a Cisco voicemail organization. To create an intersite link, you select a single location from each site to act as a gateway to the other site. All directory synchronization communications pass between the two site gateways, thereby limiting the connectivity requirements and bandwidth usage to the link between those two site gateway locations.
