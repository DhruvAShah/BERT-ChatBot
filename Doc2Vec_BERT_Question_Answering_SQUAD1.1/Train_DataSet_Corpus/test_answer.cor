In physics , circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path .It can be uniform , with constant angular rate of rotation ( and constant speed ) , or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation .The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts .The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body .Examples of circular motion include : an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at constant height , a stone which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles , a car turning through a curve in a race track , an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field , and a gear turning inside a mechanism .Since the object 's velocity vector is constantly changing direction , the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation .Without this acceleration , the object would move in a straight line , according to Newton 's laws of motion .
Apollo Creed is a fictional character from the Rocky films , initially portrayed as the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World .He was played by Carl Weathers .Creed had multiple nicknames , including The Master of Disaster , The King of Sting , The Dancing Destroyer , The Prince of Punch , The One and Only and The Count of Monte Fisto .Urban legend states that Apollo Creed 's name is a wordplay on the Apostles ' Creed , a statement of belief used in Christian churches .All of Apollo 's championship fights were scheduled for the 15 round distance .Championship fights did not convert from 15 rounds to 12 rounds until 1987 .Rocky Balboa is often wrongly credited with popularizing the red , white , and blue trunks ; Creed was the first man to wear them ( latterly worn by Rocky Balboa in the 3rd and 4th installments and finally by Tommy `` The Machine '' Gunn ( Tommy Morrison ) in the 5th installment ) although normally he wore red and white , as seen in Rocky II .Balboa 's signature colors were black and gold—colors he used in the latest movie .
In the United States , the title of federal judge usually means a judge appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate pursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II of the United States Constitution .In addition to the Supreme Court of the United States , whose existence and some aspects of whose jurisdiction are beyond the constitutional power of Congress to alter , acts of Congress have established 13 courts of appeals ( also called `` circuit courts '' ) with appellate jurisdiction over different regions of the United States , and 94 United States district courts .Every judge appointed to such a court may be categorized as a federal judge ; such positions include the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court , Circuit Judges of the courts of appeals , and district judges of the United States district courts .All of these judges described thus far are referred to sometimes as `` Article III judges '' because they exercise the judicial power vested in the judicial branch of the federal government by Article III of the U.S. Constitution .In addition , judges of the Court of International Trade exercise judicial power pursuant to Article III .Other judges serving in the federal courts , including magistrate judges and bankruptcy judges , are also sometimes referred to as `` federal judges '' ; however , they are neither appointed by the President nor confirmed by the Senate , and their power derives from Article I instead .See Article I and Article III tribunals .

Variable Universal Life Insurance ( often shortened to VUL ) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value .In a VUL , the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts , similar to mutual funds , and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner .The 'variable ' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets .The 'universal ' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments .The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance .This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically can not be missed without lapsing the policy ( although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature , or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium ) .Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance , because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy .With most if not all VULs , unlike whole life , there is no endowment age ( the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount , which for whole life is typically 100 ) .This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole Life .With a typical whole life policy , the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy , and at endowment age , the face amount is all that is paid out .Thus with either death or endowment , the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years .However , some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase `` paid up additions '' to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time .If investments made in the separate accounts out-perform the general account of the insurance company , a higher rate-of-return can occur than the fixed rates-of-return typical for whole life .The combination over the years of no endowment age , continually increasing death benefit , and if a high rate-of-return is earned in the separate accounts of a VUL policy , this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums .

University HallPurdue University , located in West Lafayette , Indiana , is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system .Purdue was founded on May 6 , 1869 , as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly , taking advantage of the Morrill Act , accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science , technology , and agriculture in his name .The first classes were held on September 16 , 1874 , with six instructors and 39 students .Today , Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference , and is a well known world-class research institution .Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States .Purdue offers both undergraduate and graduate programs in over 211 major areas of study , and is well known for its competitive engineering curricula .The university has also been highly influential in America 's history of aviation , having established the first college credit offered in flight training , the first four-year bachelor 's degree in aviation , and the first university airport ( Purdue University Airport ) .Purdue 's aviation technology program remains one of the most competitive aviation-specific programs in the world .In the mid-20th century , Purdue 's aviation program expanded to encompass advanced spaceflight technology giving rise to Purdue 's nickname , Cradle of Astronauts .Twenty-three Purdue graduates have gone on to become astronauts , including Gus Grissom ( one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts ) , Neil Armstrong ( the first person to walk on the moon ) , and Eugene Cernan ( the most recent person to walk on the moon ) .
A sebaceous cyst ( ) is a term that loosely refers to either epidermoid cysts ( also known as epidermal cysts ; L72.0 ) or pilar cysts ( also known as trichilemmal cysts ; L72.1 ) .Because an epidermoid cyst originates in the epidermis and a pilar cyst originates from hair follicles , by definition , neither type of cyst is strictly a sebaceous cyst .The name is regarded as a misnomer as the fatty , white , semi-solid material in both of these cyst entities is not sebum , but keratin .Furthermore , under the microscope neither entity contains sebaceous glands .In practice , however , the terms are often used interchangeably .`` True '' sebaceous cysts are relatively rare and are known as steatocystomas or , if multiple , as steatocystoma multiplex .
Modern pointe shoes .The edge of the toe pad , which is inserted between the foot and toe box for cushioning , can be seen on the right foot .A pointe shoe is a type of shoe worn by ballet dancers when performing pointe work .Pointe shoes developed from the desire for dancers to appear weightless and sylph -like and have evolved to enable dancers to dance en pointe ( on the tips of their toes ) for extended periods of time .They are normally worn by female dancers , though male dancers may wear them for unorthodox roles such as the ugly stepsisters in Cinderella , Bottom in A Midsummer Night 's Dream , or men performing as women in dance companies such as Les Ballets Trockadero and Grandiva .They are manufactured in a variety of colors , most commonly in shades of light pink .
This tablespoon has a capacity of about 15 mL .Measuring SpoonsIn the US and parts of Canada , a tablespoon is the largest type of spoon used for eating from a bowl .In the UK , Europe and most Commonwealth countries , a tablespoon is a type of large spoon usually used for serving .In countries where a tablespoon is a serving spoon , the nearest equivalent to the US tablespoon is either the dessert spoon or the soup spoon .A tablespoonful , nominally the capacity of one tablespoon , is commonly used as a measure of volume in cooking .It is abbreviated as T , tb , tbs , tbsp , tblsp , or tblspn .The capacity of ordinary tablespoons is not regulated by law and is subject to considerable variation .In the USA one tablespoon ( measurement unit ) is approximately 15 mL ; the capacity of an actual tablespoon ( dining utensil ) ranges from 7 mL to 14 mL .In Australia one tablespoon ( measurement unit ) is 20 mL .

Cholera is an infection in the small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae .The main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting .Transmission occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces ( waste product ) of an infected person , including one with no apparent symptoms .The severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance , and death in some cases .The primary treatment is oral rehydration therapy , typically with oral rehydration solution , to replace water and electrolytes .If this is not tolerated or does not provide improvement fast enough , intravenous fluids can also be used .Antibacterial drugs are beneficial in those with severe disease to shorten its duration and severity .Worldwide , it affects 3–5 million people and causes 100,000–130,000 deaths a year .Cholera was one of the earliest infections to be studied by epidemiological methods .
The Picture of Dorian Gray is the only published novel by Oscar Wilde , appearing as the lead story in Lippincott 's Monthly Magazine on 20 June 1890 , printed as the July 1890 issue of this magazine .The magazine 's editors feared the story was indecent as submitted , so they censored roughly 500 words , without Wilde 's knowledge , before publication .But even with that , the story was still greeted with outrage by British reviewers , some of whom suggested that Wilde should be prosecuted on moral grounds , leading Wilde to defend the novel aggressively in letters to the British press .Wilde later revised the story for book publication , making substantial alterations , deleting controversial passages , adding new chapters and including an aphoristic Preface which has since become famous in its own right .The amended version was published by Ward , Lock and Company in April 1891 .Some scholars believe that Wilde would today have wanted us to read the version he originally submitted to Lippincott 's .The novel tells of a young man named Dorian Gray , the subject of a painting by artist Basil Hallward .Basil is impressed by Dorian 's beauty and becomes infatuated with him , believing his beauty is responsible for a new mode in his art .Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton , a friend of Basil 's , and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry 's world view .Espousing a new hedonism , Lord Henry suggests the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfilment of the senses .Realizing that one day his beauty will fade , Dorian ( whimsically ) expresses a desire to sell his soul to ensure the portrait Basil has painted would age rather than he .Dorian 's wish is fulfilled , and when he subsequently pursues a life of debauchery , the portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul , with each sin displayed as a disfigurement of his form , or through a sign of aging .The Picture of Dorian Gray is considered a work of classic Gothic fiction with a strong Faustian theme .

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , also known as chronic obstructive lung disease ( COLD ) , chronic obstructive airway disease ( COAD ) , chronic airflow limitation ( CAL ) and chronic obstructive respiratory disease ( CORD ) , is the occurrence of chronic bronchitis or emphysema , a pair of commonly co-existing diseases of the lungs in which the airways narrow over time .This limits airflow to and from the lungs , causing shortness of breath ( dyspnea ) .In clinical practice , COPD is defined by its characteristically low airflow on lung function tests .In contrast to asthma , this limitation is poorly reversible and usually gets progressively worse over time .COPD is caused by noxious particles or gas , most commonly from tobacco smoking , which triggers an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung .The diagnosis of COPD requires lung function tests .Important management strategies are smoking cessation , vaccinations , rehabilitation , and drug therapy ( often using inhalers ) .Some patients go on to require long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation .Worldwide , COPD ranked as the sixth leading cause of death in 1990 .It is projected to become the fourth leading cause of death worldwide by 2030 , due to an increase in smoking rates and demographic changes in many countries .COPD is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. , and the economic burden of COPD in the U.S. in 2007 was $ 42.6 billion in health care costs and lost productivity .

Deepwater drilling is the process of oil and gas exploration and production in depths of more than 500 feet .By this definition , there are approximately 600 deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico .It has been economically infeasible for many years , but with rising oil prices , more companies are investing in this area .Major companies working in this sector include Diamond Offshore , TransOcean , and Baker Hughes .There are basically two kinds of mobile deepwater drilling rigs : semi-submersible drilling rigs and drillships .Drilling can also be performed from a fixed-position installation such as a floating spar ( platform ) or tension-leg platform .Recent industry analysis has estimated that the total expenditure in the global deepwater infrastructure market will reach $ 145bn in 2011 .“Not all oil is accessible on land or in shallow water .You can find some oil deposits buried deep under the ocean floor.” ... Using sonic equipment , oil companies determine the drilling sites most likely to produce oil .Then they use a mobile offshore drilling unit ( MODU ) to dig the initial well .Some units are converted into production rigs , meaning they switch from drilling for oil to capturing oil once it 's found .Most of the time , the oil company will replace the MODU with a more permanent oil production rig to capture oil.” ... The MODU 's job is to drill down into the ocean 's floor to find oil deposits .The part of the drill that extends below the deck and through the water is called the riser .The riser allows for drilling fluids to move between the floor and the rig .Engineers lower a drill string -- a series of pipes designed to drill down to the oil deposit -- through the riser.”“The expansion of deepwater drilling is happening despite accidents in offshore fields ... ”In 2010 a large explosion occurred killing 11 workers and spilling millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico while a BP oil rig was drilling in deep waters .“ ... Despite the risks , the deepwater drilling trend is spreading in the Mediterranean and off the coast of East Africa after a string of huge discoveries of natural gas.”“The reason for the resumption of such drilling , analyst say , is continuing high demand for energy worldwide.”America needs the oil so it is almost necessary to face the high risks that come with deepwater drilling in order for Americans to continue to carry on their everyday lives .“The Energy Department recently projected that gulf oil production would expand from its 2011 level of 1.3 million barrels a day , still nearly a quarter of total domestic production , to 2 million barrels a day by 2020.”Deepwater drilling affects the environment in both negative and positive ways .Although Deepwater drilling rarely causes oil spills it is still a hazardous possible outcome .Oil spills result in oil sinking to the bottom of the ocean smothering plant life leaving fish without food and shelter to survive .On the other hand deepwater drilling effects the environment in a positive ways too .In time once the deepwater oil well is not in use anymore plants will grow on and around the well making a cave or cavern like shelter ideal for animals to thrive in .Deepwater drilling also lets us see the depths of the ocean floor that are hardly ever seen .”Cameras on rovers at the bottom of the wells record footage and take photos of rare fish that are in there natural habitat , giving scientist a look at animals they rarely seen” ( Chevron Corporation ) .
